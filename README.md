# Juan_Singtel

1- I make all methods in com.singtel.animals package as public for test 
because I put all test file in the other source folder and other package for easy maintenance.

2- Each question was annotated in the proper code was placed.

3- Question A-3-b, rooster is a kind of chicken, so we can inherit it from chicken.

4- Question A-3-c, if need create a rooster without inheritance, we can create an independent class of rooster itself.

5- Question A-4, parrot inherit from birds with overloading sing(String neighbor, String sound)  key value pairs.

6- Question B-2-b, see code of Fish, an attack(boolean i) method is added, unit test is created.

6- Question B-3-a, Dolphins extends from Animal not Fish. Add Swim() to Animal class.

7- Question B-3-b, make parent class more commonly and simplest to avoid duplicating code or introducing unneeded overhead

8- Question C, make parent class Animal having three methods, walk(), fly(),swim(). Butterfly and Caterpiller class inherit from Animal class

9- Question D, see code

10- Question E, the solution see Solution.java under com.singtel.animals with objects of Animal:
	duck,chicken,rooster,parrort,fish,shark,clownfish,dolphins,frog,butterfly
